Example Usage
=============

smolder 10.0.0.1 example_test.json --force


What it does
============

It wraps the "requests" python library inserting headers, authentication etc and
making your requests to a host, provided as a command line argument.

It checks the response from the server for expected status codes and
body/header/json dpath contents and passes or fails the test based on definition.

Can be used to specify and pass/fail on performance of api response.

Copy/paste curl equivalent of the request is included in the output for
convenience.

See the example_test.json file for a subset of the the tests
available.

Easily introduced into a CI/CD deploy pipeline.

Without --force, any API requests that are not GET's will be skipped as a safety
mechanism to ensure we're not overwriting or creating data unconciously.


Installation
============

git clone gitlab@git.bskyb.com/lsd/smolder.git
cd smolder
pip install .
