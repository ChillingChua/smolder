Examples
========

Here are some contrived examples that you can run.  This github tests status.github.com on port 80 and expects to be redirected to https://status.github.com/ with a 301.  It then tests https://status.github.com/ and FAILs if github is reporting issues on their status page.  I expect the final test of site speed to fail as 200ms is typically about half the normal page load time for status.github.com.

smolder-cli status.github.com github_status.json

smolder-cli status.aws.amazon.com aws_status.json

This example tests an RFC1928 address by trying to PUT data to it and verifying the result. (This won't work out of the box: it tests some random API)

smolder-cli 10.0.0.1 example_test.json --force

This example tests an https endpoint which has an issue with it's certificate:

smolder-cli 173.223.194.219 examples/soa_test.json
